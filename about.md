My name is James Rowe and I love programming and making cool things in my spare time. I'm currently attending my last semester as a Computer Science major at Brigham Young University and I'm writing a 2d game in Libgdx in my spare time. In the future, I hope to use this space to record my adventures in programming and write a few posts about the game I'm making as well.
